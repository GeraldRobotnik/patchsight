# PatchSight

PatchSight is a vision-assisted automation system designed to improve patch alignment,
inspection, and downstream laser or embroidery workflows.

## Problem
Manual patch alignment introduces error, waste, and labor bottlenecks in small-batch
and scalable embroidery operations.

## Solution
PatchSight uses computer vision, geometric correction, and machine control interfaces
to:
- Detect patch contours and orientation
- Correct skew and offset
- Automate placement and downstream processing

## Current Status
Documentation-first phase.
No active production deployment.
Proof-of-concept testing underway.

## Core Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- DepthAI (OAK-D optional)
- Raspberry Pi / x86
- Flux Beamo / Embroidery machine interfaces

## Roadmap
See `/docs/roadmap.md`

## Architecture
